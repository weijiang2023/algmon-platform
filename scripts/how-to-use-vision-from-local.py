'''
Uploading base 64 encoded images

If you have an image or set of images locally, you can pass those to the model in base 64 encoded format, here is an example of this in action:
'''
import base64
import requests

# OpenAI API Key
api_key = ""

# Function to encode the image


def encode_image(image_path):
    with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')


# Path to your image
image_path = "./in/students.png"

# Getting the base64 string
base64_image = encode_image(image_path)

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
}

payload = {
    "model": "gpt-4-vision-preview",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "这张图片描述了什么?"
                },
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image}"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 300
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", headers=headers, json=payload)

print(response.json())
